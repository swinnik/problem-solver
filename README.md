# OpenAI API demonstration

The purpose of this app is to demonstrate that I can deploy a single page React App using AWS EC2, using a CI/CD pipeline. Taking advantage of the OpenAI /completion endpoint.
This Generative AI is pre-loaded with my Resume and Experience and can give insights into my ability to solve your real problems.

However...GPT does sometimes make things up, so if you need clarification on my actual skills, please contact me directly.
